# backtracking_alogorithm_placingQueen
backtracking algorithm for placing queen 
question : in how many way we can place queen in each row which they dont thread each other?
for solving this problem we can use backtracking algorithm which start 
with an empty solution and extends the solution step by step. 
The search recursively goes through all different ways how a solution can be constructed.
