# backtracking_alogorithm_placingQueen

Eight queens puzzle:
In this repo I provide a Backtracking algorithm for the 8 queen problem (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight_queens_puzzle).for solving this problem we can use backtracking algorithm which start with an empty solution and extends the solution step by step. The search recursively goes through all different ways how a solution can be constructed.
